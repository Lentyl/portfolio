I feel confident using them and believe I am suitable for Web Developer/Software QA Engineer roles. When I design and build applications I often use new technologies and libraries that I haven't used before. Thanks to this approach I expand my knowledge and familiarise myself with new tools, and keep up to date in the fast changing space of web development.",
